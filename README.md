# Code Refactor Starter Code

Refactoring the code from the urban-octo-telegram repository in order to complete the HTML CSS Git Challenge for the CodingBootcamp

## Actions

**Steps**
Markup: \* Cloned the urban-octo-telegram repository to my system and followed the instruction from the following website
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18200248/cloning-a-repo-from-someone-elses-github-and-pushing-it-to-a-repo-on-my-github
so my changes would be pushed to my own 01-htmlCssGit repository

- Viewed the code and made appropriate changes in order to meet the Challenge Requirements
  - User Code
    - AS A marketing agency
    - I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
    - SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
  - Acceptance Criteria
    - GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    - WHEN I view the source code
    - THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    - WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    - THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    - WHEN I view the image elements
    - THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    - WHEN I view the heading attributes
    - THEN they fall in sequential order
    - WHEN I view the title element
    - THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
